The stalemate in Spanish politics has entered its second month and shows no sign of resolution. The 20 December 2015 general elections ended in a four-way stalemate, with no single party or likely coalition achieving a majority.
On 22 January, Spain's king invited conservative (PP) leader Mariano Rajoy to form a government. However, Rajoy strategically declined the offer, as he had no realistic prospect of winning the parliamentary vote necessary to confirm his position as president.
The conservative PP was the highest-voted party, winning 123 seats in the 350-seat parliament. However, their right-wing fellow-travelers Ciudadanos (Citizens) won only 40 seats, leaving the likely coalition and favorite of Bloomberg short of the 176 seats necessary to form a majority government.
Meanwhile, the misleadingly named Socialist Workers Party (PSOE), which has been a stalwart of Spanish democracy since the end of the Franco dictatorship and which governed from 1982--1996 and from 2004--2011, was reduced to a representation of just 90 seats. The PSOE vote superseded that of the new left party Podemos (We Can) by just 1.35 percent nationwide. With Podemos' vote concentrated in the industrialized north and northeast, which have lower parliamentary representation than rural areas, the party won just 69 seats.
